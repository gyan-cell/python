"""
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.
It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language
for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms."""
"""
Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support
for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. 
On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language,
it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python
is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.
Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs.
It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs
— or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls,
sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.

"""
Working With Python Interpreter :  The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.13 on those
machines where it is available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command: 
python3.13
When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode. 
In this mode it prompts for the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>);
for continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...).
The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:
